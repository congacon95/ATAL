The composition allowed Trivest to acquire certain of Freedom Metals’ operating assets without the risk of facing potential successor liability claims or having to assume all liabilities, all without the need of a bankruptcy or other judicial intervention. Virtually all creditors participated in the composition and received more than they would have if Freedom Metals had been liquidated through bankruptcy proceedings.

The Court approved the highly complex sale over multiple objections of several competing bidders, creditors and interest holders at a final evidentiary hearing following a nearly 24 hour ""auction,"" overcoming competing bids from LexisNexis, Experian and Warburg Pincus, resulting in a gross sale proceeds of approximately $165 million.
